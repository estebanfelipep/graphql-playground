# graphql-playground

This is a set of two applications that I created to learn about GraphQL. 

The applications are:
- A server that serves a GraphQL API: This is a Node.js application that uses Apollo Server to create a GraphQL API. It uses better-sqlite3 to store an expense tracker app data in a SQLite database. The API is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a focus on learning the basics of GraphQL.
- A client that consumes the GraphQL API: This is a React application that uses React Query to consume the GraphQL API. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a focus on learning the basics of GraphQL.

Some of the topics I cover are:
- GraphQL API creation: This includes the creation of resolvers, types, and queries.
- GraphQL API consumption
- GraphQL code generation
